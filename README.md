In summary, employees were more likely to leave the company if:

•They were doing overtime
•They had a smaller monthly income
•They worked at the company for a shorter period of time

There were other factors too but they were not as dominant at predicting attrition. Those included:

•Job Satisfaction
•Age
•Education Field
•Relationship Satisfaction

The highest predictive accuracy achieved was by the Random Forest algorithm at 75.9% however it also had the lowest precision of 30.1%. In simple terms, this means that Random Forest correctly predicted
75.9% of all the employees that were going to leave but for all the instances when the model predicted that the employee would leave, it was right only 30.1% of the time. This is acceptable as its better to classify non leaving employees as leaving rather than leaving employees as non-leaving.
